It includes both armed and unarmed fighting systems. Our current fencing practice is inspired by historical manuscripts, printed sources and equipment that seeks to have comparable qualities to weapons used in close quarter combat. Considering systematic instructions for close combat, the sources reach as far back as the 14th century."
